# Cruzcourse
CruzCourse is an online website that can be accessed at the url https://cruzcourse.com/ . As it is
an operational web application, it does not have to be downloaded or installed in any way shape
or form. It can be accessed from any device with an internet connection and browser.
Upon initial connection, the user is presented by a visually appealing interface highlighting
various factors of the UCSC faculty and courses. From here, the user can navigate the site using
the buttons located at the top of their screen. Professor information as well as course information
can be accessed in this fashion. The about page is also here as well.
For both course information as well as professor information, various filtering options are
available to help a user find the specific information should he/she desire to look up a particular
course/professor.
Furthermore, the user may log in using Facebook, augmenting the userâ€™s experience with the
program. Upon successful login, the user may choose to upload his/her UCSC transcript in pdf
format. With this information, the site will now be able to tell the user which courses he/she is
able to take alongside recommended courses for both his/her major as well as his/her general
education requirements.
Users are highly encouraged to upload their transcripts in order to make the most out of their
CruzCourse experience, and to better map their future college career.
From all of us in the FaceCourse team, we hope you enjoy your time using our software!
